# script

- storyline:

@file: always open to someone capable of arriving at my addresses.
@memory: goes onto describe some pattern with the help of other description to form different pattern
@process: i will see if file can have addressible changes. only when there are changes resembling some action, i will pay attention to the preceeding addresses.
@action: i could be called with something, but i will only respond with resonable something else, if you ask me something that you know i should know and there is an expectation via which i will be compelled to send a response your way!

- characters:

@python: eval
@bash: python3 -i
@text: f = open(file, "r")
@f : read() -> data
@data : contents of file
@these : list of strings

- scenes:

for data, see if one can detect any of {these} patterns. if one does, eval the lines before it and put the results after it.
if results are written, write something indicating that it was done. if you gotta come up with it, please add that to {these} or just select one.
